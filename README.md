Hello world,

I am Andrew. I was born in Victoria, BC and moved to Hong Kong at a very young age where I received my childhood education. At the age of 16 I ventured to the United States of America and attended an international boarding school--Armand Hammer United World College. After high school, I took two gap years which I mostly worked in Hong Kong but also had the opportunity to travel in America and Europe. I decided to attend a community college in California after my two gap years. Upon completing one year of education at the community college, I transferred to Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, IN where I received my Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering. I also minored in Mathematics and Economics at Rose. I decided to return to my country of birth after graduation and found myself in the city of Toronto, after spending the longest and coldest winter in my life, I returned to the city where I grew up--Hong Kong. So many things have changed yet there are so many things that are still the same here. Now, I am ready to take on a new challenge and this is the first step of that challenge.

Andrew
